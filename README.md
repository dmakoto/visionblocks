Vision Blocks
============
Vision Blocks is a platform that enables users with no programming experience to create Computer Vision based applications. It gives the user an intuitive visual programming environment based on blocks, with a simple drag-and-drop interface. The project has a web and a mobile interface, and utilizes a remote camera such as a track cam, a local webcam, or even an image as input.
